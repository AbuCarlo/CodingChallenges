# README for Anthony Nassar's reimplementation of the wc Unix command-line utility

The problem is specified here: https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-1

## Scope

All functionality described here is implemented: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html

BSD-style options with two dashes, i.e. `--byte-count`, are not supported, since they're not 
idiomatic to Go.
