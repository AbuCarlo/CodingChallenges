## #1, "Build your own wc!"

Cf. https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-1

I started work on this on 2024-10-17. See folder `./ccwc`.

This is still in development, which should really move to Unix, so that
a strict comparison of my implementation to the canonical one will make sense.
Otherwise, I'm relying on someone's outdated port of `coreutils` to Windows, 
where expectations regarding encoding might be different.

Update: I "shipped" this on 2024-11-06.
