## #1, "Build your own wc!"

I started work on this on 2024-10-17. See folder `./ccwc`.

This is still in development. Still to do:

- Write parametrized tests to verify my output against known `wc` output.
- Decide on help format for Windows vs. Unix.
- Decide on a version string with copyright.
- Test different encodings against GNU's `wc`.
- Deal with long text files that will overrun the 64K buffer.
